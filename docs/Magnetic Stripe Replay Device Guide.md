# **Magnetic Stripe Emulation: A Technical Compendium of MagSpoof Devices and a Developer's Guide to Android-Based Control Systems**

## **Introduction**

### **Purpose and Scope**

This report provides an exhaustive technical analysis of hardware designed for magnetic stripe emulation, with a primary focus on the MagSpoof family of devices and their functional analogues. The document is structured into two main parts. Part I offers a comprehensive catalog of these devices, detailing their evolution, technical specifications, and operational principles. Part II serves as a developer-oriented guide, presenting a detailed methodology for conceptualizing and implementing an Android application to manage and control these hardware tools in real-time.

### **Target Audience**

This document is intended for an audience with a proficient understanding of electronics, embedded systems programming, and Android application development. The content is tailored for cybersecurity researchers, hardware security professionals, and embedded systems developers seeking to understand or create tools for magnetic stripe security analysis.

### **Core Technology Overview**

Magnetic stripe cards store data by modifying the magnetism of tiny iron-based particles on a band of material. The data is encoded using a method known as Frequency/Double Frequency (F2F) or Aiken biphase encoding. In this scheme, a flux transition (a change in magnetic polarity) always occurs at the boundary of each bit cell. A binary '1' is represented by an additional transition in the middle of the bit cell, while a '0' has no mid-cell transition. Consequently, a '1' is encoded at twice the frequency of a '0'.1

Magnetic stripe "spoofing" or emulation devices, such as MagSpoof, do not physically replicate this magnetic strip. Instead, they generate a time-varying electromagnetic field using a coil (an electromagnet). By rapidly pulsing electricity through the coil, the device creates a magnetic field that changes polarity in a pattern that precisely mimics the flux transitions a card reader's head would detect during a physical swipe. This allows the device to transmit the stored track data to a standard magnetic stripe reader wirelessly, without any physical contact.1

### **Ethical and Legal Disclaimer**

The devices and techniques described in this report are powerful tools intended strictly for authorized security auditing, academic research, and educational purposes. The emulation of magnetic stripe data without the explicit, legal authorization of the card owner and the system operator is illegal in most jurisdictions and constitutes fraud. This report does not endorse or provide the means for any illicit activities. The information is presented to aid security professionals in understanding and assessing vulnerabilities in magnetic stripe-based systems. Users of such tools are solely responsible for ensuring their actions comply with all applicable laws and regulations.3

## **Part I: A Comprehensive Catalog of Magnetic Stripe Emulation Devices**

### **Chapter 1: The MagSpoof Family and its Evolution**

The landscape of magnetic stripe emulation tools is largely defined by the foundational work of security researcher Samy Kamkar and the subsequent commercial evolution of his design by companies like Electronic Cats.

#### **1.1 The Genesis: Samy Kamkar's Original MagSpoof**

The original MagSpoof project, created by Samy Kamkar, served as the open-source blueprint for nearly all subsequent devices in this category.6 It was conceived as a low-cost, do-it-yourself (DIY) device that could demonstrate the feasibility of wireless magnetic stripe emulation.

The core hardware consisted of a minimal set of readily available electronic components: a microcontroller (typically an 8-bit Atmel ATtiny85), a motor driver IC to handle the current required for the coil (such as the L293D), magnet wire to create the electromagnet, a resistor, a switch, an LED for status indication, and a battery for power.4 Its function was to store magnetic stripe data within the microcontroller's memory and, upon activation, replay that data by generating a strong, fluctuating electromagnetic field. This field is powerful enough to be read by a standard magnetic stripe reader from a short distance, effectively "spoofing" a card swipe.6 The original project demonstrated support for all three magnetic stripe tracks and introduced the concept of modifying the "service code" on a card's data to potentially bypass Chip-and-PIN (EMV) requirements on certain point-of-sale terminals.6

#### **1.2 Commercial Evolution by Electronic Cats: V3, V4, and V5**

Electronic Cats, a hardware development company, took Kamkar's open-source design and created a series of refined, commercial versions, making the technology more accessible and user-friendly for the security research community.

* **MagSpoof V3:** This version marked a significant leap in usability. It replaced the 8-bit microcontroller with a more powerful 32-bit SAMD11 ARM Cortex-M0 MCU. The most notable improvement was the inclusion of a USB port, which allowed the device to be programmed directly from the Arduino IDE without needing a separate external programmer. It also integrated a LiPo battery charging circuit, streamlining its use as a portable tool.9  
* **MagSpoof V4:** This iteration continued the trend of refinement, built around an 8-bit CH55x series microcontroller. It maintained USB programmability through the Arduino IDE, requiring the installation of a specific ch55xduino boards manager core. For Windows users, driver installation was facilitated by the Zadig utility.5 The V4 supports emulation of all three magnetic stripe tracks and can emulate Tracks 1 and 2 simultaneously, a key feature for replicating standard payment cards.3  
* **MagSpoof V5:** As the latest version in the series, the MagSpoof V5 features a CH552G microcontroller and modernizes the physical interface with a USB-C connector for programming and charging.10 It retains the core functionalities of its predecessors, offering a polished and up-to-date hardware platform for magnetic stripe emulation.11

#### **1.3 Comparative Analysis and Getting Started Guides**

The progression of MagSpoof devices reveals a clear trajectory toward greater ease of use and abstraction for the end-user. The initial DIY design required a fair amount of expertise in low-level embedded systems, including the use of In-Circuit Serial Programmers (ICSP) and external power management.4 The subsequent commercial versions from Electronic Cats systematically removed these barriers. The introduction of native USB programming via the Arduino IDE 5 was a pivotal change, as it allowed researchers who were more software-focused to utilize the hardware without needing to master complex toolchains like avr-gcc. This evolution signifies a maturation in the hardware security tool market, where user experience and a lower barrier to entry are becoming critical features.

Another key engineering improvement is the standardization of components. While early DIY designs often used the L293D, a general-purpose H-bridge motor driver 12, the commercial versions standardized on the TC4424.4 The TC4424 is a dedicated high-speed power MOSFET driver, which is more efficient and effective at rapidly switching the high current needed by the coil. This component choice is not arbitrary; it directly enhances the reliability of the emulation by producing a cleaner, stronger magnetic field, representing a significant technical refinement over hobbyist-grade designs.4

   * Locate the character arrays or strings that hold the track data (e.g., track1\_data, track2\_data).5  
   * Carefully replace the placeholder data with the data you obtained in the previous step, paying close attention to character encoding requirements (e.g., changing & to ^ for Track 1).5  
5. **Upload Firmware:**  
   * Connect your MagSpoof device to the computer via USB. For some devices like the V4, you may need to enter bootloader mode by shorting specific pins (e.g., JP1) while connecting.5  
   * In the Arduino IDE, select the correct board and port from the Tools menu.  
   * Click the "Upload" button to compile and flash the firmware to the device.5

### **Chapter 2: Multi-Function Security Tools with MagSpoof Capability**

The success of single-purpose tools like MagSpoof has led to the development of integrated platforms that combine multiple security research functions into a single device. This reflects a broader trend in the penetration testing community towards consolidated, multi-protocol hardware.

#### **2.1 NFC Copy Cat: Bridging NFC and MagStripe**

The NFC Copy Cat is a device designed specifically for researching payment systems by combining Near Field Communication (NFC) and magnetic stripe emulation capabilities.17 It is built on a 32-bit SAMD21 ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller, which is powerful enough to handle both protocols. The hardware includes support for CircuitPython, an integrated 3.7V battery charger, and compatibility with common NFC modules like the Adafruit PN532 breakout.18 Functionally, the device can be programmed via the Arduino IDE to read or emulate NFC tags and, with the press of a different button, trigger the MagSpoof coil to transmit magnetic stripe data.18 This allows a researcher to test systems that may have both NFC and magnetic stripe readers from a single, portable tool.

Figure 3: The NFC Copy Cat by Electronic Cats, combining NFC and MagSpoof functionalities.20

#### **2.2 BomberCat: The All-in-One Pentesting Platform**

The BomberCat represents a further step in this integration, creating a highly versatile "Swiss Army knife" for wireless security research. It incorporates NFC, MagSpoof, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) into one platform.21 This is achieved through a sophisticated dual-microcontroller architecture: a Raspberry Pi RP2040 (dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+) acts as the main processor, handling USB and interfacing with a high-performance PN7150 NFC chip, while an ESP32 co-processor provides the Wi-Fi and BLE connectivity.21 This powerful combination, programmable with Arduino, CircuitPython, or Micropython, enables advanced attack scenarios previously requiring multiple devices and a separate computer. For example, a researcher could use the BomberCat to perform a relay attack, capturing NFC or magnetic stripe data in one location and transmitting it over a Wi-Fi network to a second BomberCat device at a remote terminal in real-time.21

The development of these multi-function tools illustrates the convergence of specialized hardware into comprehensive platforms. Where a security audit once required a bag of disparate gadgets, a single device like the BomberCat can now cover multiple wireless protocols. This not only increases convenience but also enables more complex, cross-protocol attack chains, pushing the boundaries of security research.

### **Chapter 3: The Flipper Zero MagSpoof Ecosystem**

The Flipper Zero, a popular multi-tool for hardware security research, has become a major platform for MagSpoof functionality due to its extensible nature.

#### **3.1 Overview of the Flipper Zero Platform**

The Flipper Zero is a portable, open-source device designed for interacting with a wide range of digital and physical systems. A key feature is its 18-pin General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) header, which allows external hardware modules to be connected, significantly expanding its capabilities.25

#### **3.2 Official and Community-Developed MagSpoof Modules**

A vibrant ecosystem of MagSpoof modules has emerged for the Flipper Zero, leveraging its GPIO interface.

* **Electronic Cats Modules:** Electronic Cats produces an official Flipper Add-On: MagSpoof, which is a straightforward module providing the core MagSpoof circuit (TC4424 driver and coil) adapted for the Flipper's pinout.14 They also offer the Flipper Add-On: Marauder\_Spoof, a more advanced module that combines MagSpoof functionality with the ESP32-based Marauder firmware for Wi-Fi penetration testing.26  
* **Community Modules:** The open nature of the Flipper platform has encouraged community members to design and sell their own modules. Notable examples include Rabbit-Labs' "Multi Pass MagSpoof," which is designed to be as thin as a credit card to improve compatibility with shielded or recessed readers, and "flipspoof" by user astro.28

This modular approach is a powerful driver of innovation. The Flipper Zero provides a standardized and popular base platform (with a screen, battery, controls, and software framework), allowing hardware developers to focus solely on creating specialized add-ons. This creates a symbiotic relationship where the availability of diverse modules enhances the value of the Flipper, and the Flipper's popularity creates a ready market for module creators. This model has proven to be more effective at fostering rapid innovation and a wide variety of tools compared to closed, monolithic systems.

#### **3.3 Setup, Firmware, and Usage Guide**

Using a MagSpoof module with the Flipper Zero involves a specific software and data management workflow.

1. **Firmware Installation:** To ensure compatibility with external GPIO modules and applications, it is often necessary to install a custom firmware on the Flipper Zero. The "Unleashed" firmware is frequently recommended for use with Electronic Cats' shields and the MagSpoof application.30  
2. **Application Installation:** The MagSpoof functionality is managed by a dedicated Flipper Application (.fap file). A popular version is maintained by developer zacharyweiss and can be downloaded from its GitHub repository or an app store like the Flipper Lab.28 The .fap file is copied to the apps/GPIO folder on the Flipper's microSD card.  
3. **Data Management:** Magnetic stripe data is stored in plain text files with a .mag extension.  
   * Using a USB magstripe reader, obtain the track data from an authorized card.  
   * Create a text file using a template. The file contains headers like Filetype: Flipper Magstripe, Version: 1, and fields for Track 1 and Track 2 data.30  
   * Populate the track fields with the captured data.  
   * Copy the completed .mag file to the Flipper's microSD card, typically into the mag folder or, for newer app versions, apps\_data/magspoof/.28  
4. **Emulation Process:**  
   * Attach the MagSpoof module to the Flipper's GPIO pins.  
   * Navigate to GPIO \-\> on the Flipper's menu.  
   * Select "Saved Cards" and choose the desired .mag file.  
   * In the "Config" menu, select which tracks to emulate (e.g., "Track 1 & 2").  
   * Return to the main screen for that card and select "Send" or "Emulate" to begin transmission.30  
5. **Pinout and Power:** The standard MagSpoof app for Flipper Zero uses GPIO pins A7, A6, and A4 by default, though this can be configured for custom boards.28 Most modules include a physical switch to select between 3.3V and 5V power. For greater wireless range, 5V is recommended, which can be enabled in the Flipper's GPIO menu or is automatically supplied when connected via USB.25

### **Chapter 4: Principles of DIY MagSpoof Construction**

For those inclined to build their own device, understanding the core principles of the circuit and firmware is essential.

#### **4.1 The Fundamental Circuit**

A DIY MagSpoof device is fundamentally simple. It requires three main components:

1. **Microcontroller:** Any small microcontroller with a few GPIO pins and precise timing capabilities will suffice. Popular choices include the ATtiny85, Arduino boards (Nano, Pro Mini), or ESP32.13  
2. **Driver IC:** The microcontroller's GPIO pins cannot supply enough current to drive the electromagnet directly. An H-bridge or motor driver IC, such as the L293D or SN754410, is used as an amplifier. It takes the low-current logic signals from the microcontroller and uses them to switch a higher-current power source (the battery) across the coil.13  
3. **Electromagnet (Coil):** This is the component that generates the magnetic field. It is simply a coil of insulated copper wire (magnet wire).33

The microcontroller is programmed to send a sequence of timed digital pulses to the driver IC. The driver, in turn, rapidly reverses the direction of current flowing through the coil. This rapid reversal of current creates the alternating magnetic field necessary to emulate the flux transitions of a physical magnetic stripe.13

#### **4.2 The Electromagnet: Coil Design and Challenges**

The single most critical and challenging aspect of a DIY build is the electromagnet. While the digital electronics are largely commoditized and the firmware logic is well-understood, the physical properties of the coil dictate the device's performance. The primary goal is to generate a magnetic field strong enough to be reliably detected by a card reader, some of which may have shielding to prevent electromagnetic interference.28

Approaches to coil construction vary:

* **Salvaging:** Coils can be harvested from existing components like small speakers, headphones, or transformers.13  
* **Custom Winding:** A more effective method is to wind a custom coil using thin magnet wire around a core. The number of turns, wire gauge, and core material all significantly impact the resulting field strength.1

A significant challenge arises when attempting to create a device with a credit card form factor. Using PCB traces to form the coil is an elegant solution, but it is prone to failure. If traces on the top and bottom layers of the PCB are aligned, their magnetic fields can cancel each other out, resulting in a net field that is too weak to be detected. While angling the traces can mitigate this, the field strength produced by PCB traces is often insufficient compared to a traditional wire-wound coil.1 The ultimate performance of any MagSpoof device is therefore less dependent on the sophistication of its microcontroller and more on the fundamental physics of its coil design.

#### **4.3 Firmware Logic**

The firmware is responsible for translating the stored track data, which is typically in an ASCII-like format, into the precise electrical signals for F2F encoding. The process involves several steps:

1. **Data Storage:** The track data is stored in the microcontroller's memory as character arrays or strings.  
2. **Bit-level Processing:** The firmware iterates through each character of the track data. For each character, it processes its constituent bits (e.g., 4 data bits and 1 parity bit for Track 2).35  
3. **Timing and Pulsing:** For each bit, the firmware generates a precisely timed pulse or pair of pulses sent to the driver IC. A '0' bit corresponds to a single pulse of a base duration ($T$), while a '1' bit corresponds to two pulses of half that duration ($T/2$).1  
4. **Error Checking:** The firmware must also calculate and transmit parity bits for each character and a final Longitudinal Redundancy Check (LRC) byte at the end of the track data to ensure the transmission is valid according to ISO/IEC 7811 standards.8 Start and end sentinel characters (e.g., ';' and '?') are also transmitted to frame the data.

## **Part II: A Developer's Guide to Android Integration and Control**

### **Chapter 5: System Architecture and Communication Protocols**

Creating an Android application to manage a MagSpoof device requires a clear system architecture and a robust communication strategy.

#### **5.1 Designing the Android Control Application**

A well-architected control application should consist of three primary components:

1. **User Interface (UI) Layer:** A clean, intuitive interface for users to manage a library of magnetic stripe profiles. This includes views for listing, creating, editing, and deleting profiles.  
2. **Communication Service:** A background Android Service responsible for managing the connection to the hardware device. This ensures that the connection can be maintained even if the app is not in the foreground.  
3. **Data Persistence Layer:** A secure mechanism for storing the sensitive magnetic stripe track data on the device.

#### **5.2 Choosing a Communication Interface**

There is no single, standardized communication protocol for MagSpoof devices. The lack of a universal interface means that a comprehensive Android application must be designed to support multiple communication backends. This fragmentation significantly increases development complexity, as the app must contain an abstraction layer that can seamlessly switch between different communication drivers based on the connected hardware.

The primary interfaces are:

* **USB:** Many standalone MagSpoof devices, particularly those based on Arduino or similar platforms like the V4 and V5, use a USB connection that appears to the operating system as a virtual serial port (CDC-ACM class).5 Android's USB Host API can be used to establish a reliable, wired connection.  
* **Bluetooth:** For wireless control, Bluetooth is the preferred method.  
  * **Bluetooth Classic:** Older or simpler DIY devices may use modules like the HC-05, which implement the Serial Port Profile (SPP). This profile emulates a serial port over a Bluetooth connection.37  
  * **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE):** Modern, power-efficient devices like the BomberCat utilize BLE.21 Communication with BLE devices is more complex, involving a GATT (Generic Attribute Profile) structure of services and characteristics rather than a simple data stream.39

#### **5.3 Setting Up the Android Development Environment**

To enable communication with external hardware, the application's manifest file (AndroidManifest.xml) must declare the necessary permissions and features.

XML

\<uses-feature android:name\="android.hardware.usb.host" android:required\="true" /\>

\<uses-permission android:name\="android.permission.BLUETOOTH\_SCAN" /\>  
\<uses-permission android:name\="android.permission.BLUETOOTH\_CONNECT" /\>

\<uses-permission android:name\="android.permission.NFC" /\>  
\<uses-feature android:name\="android.hardware.nfc" android:required\="false" /\>

\<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion\="26" /\>

The uses-feature tag for USB ensures the app is only installable on devices that support USB Host mode. The Bluetooth permissions are required for modern Android versions to scan for and connect to devices.41

### **Chapter 6: Wired Control via USB Host API**

For devices like the MagSpoof V4 and V5, a wired USB connection is the most direct method of control.

#### **6.1 Discovering and Connecting to USB Devices**

The Android UsbManager class is the entry point for interacting with USB devices. The process involves enumerating connected devices, identifying the MagSpoof hardware (usually by its Vendor ID and Product ID), and requesting permission from the user to open a connection.

#### **6.2 Establishing Serial Communication**

While the raw USB Host API can be used, it is low-level and complex. A more practical approach is to use a well-maintained third-party library such as usb-serial-for-android. This library provides a high-level API that abstracts the complexities of USB endpoints and drivers, presenting a simple serial port interface for communication with devices that use common USB-to-serial chips (like CDC-ACM, FTDI, etc.).

#### **6.3 Defining and Implementing a Command Protocol**

A simple, human-readable command protocol should be implemented in both the Android app and the device's firmware. This allows the app to send commands and data to the MagSpoof device.

**Example Protocol:**

* SET\_TRACK1:\<data\>\\n: Sets the data for Track 1\.  
* SET\_TRACK2:\<data\>\\n: Sets the data for Track 2\.  
* EMULATE\\n: Triggers the emulation process.  
* GET\_STATUS\\n: Requests the device's current status.

**Android (Kotlin) Implementation:**

Kotlin

fun sendCommand(command: String) {  
    val data \= (command \+ "\\n").toByteArray()  
    usbSerialPort.write(data, WRITE\_WAIT\_MILLIS)  
}

**Arduino (C++) Firmware Implementation:**

C++

void loop() {  
  if (Serial.available() \> 0) {  
    String command \= Serial.readStringUntil('\\n');  
    if (command.startsWith("SET\_TRACK1:")) {  
      // Parse and store Track 1 data  
    } else if (command.startsWith("EMULATE")) {  
      playTracks(); // Function to start emulation  
    }  
  }  
}

### **Chapter 7: Wireless Control via Bluetooth API**

Wireless control offers greater convenience and is essential for interacting with devices like the BomberCat.

#### **7.1 Implementing Bluetooth Classic (Serial Port Profile)**

For devices using modules that support SPP, the connection process is similar to a virtual serial port.

1. Use BluetoothAdapter to discover and pair with the device.  
2. Obtain a BluetoothDevice object representing the hardware.  
3. Create a BluetoothSocket using createRfcommSocketToServiceRecord() with the standard SPP UUID (00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB).  
4. Call connect() on the socket and retrieve the InputStream and OutputStream to send and receive data, just as with a serial connection.38

#### **7.2 Implementing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**

BLE communication is event-driven and based on the GATT protocol. It is more complex than SPP.

1. **Scan and Connect:** Use the BluetoothLeScanner to scan for devices advertising specific services. Once the target device is found, use device.connectGatt() to establish a connection and obtain a BluetoothGatt object.  
2. **Service Discovery:** After connecting, call bluetoothGatt.discoverServices(). This will trigger an asynchronous discovery of the services and characteristics offered by the device. The results are delivered in the onServicesDiscovered callback.39  
3. **Identify Characteristics:** The device's firmware must define a GATT service with specific characteristics for control (e.g., a "Track 1 Data" characteristic and a "Command" characteristic). The Android app must know the UUIDs for these characteristics.  
4. **Write Data:** To send data, such as a track string or an emulate command, the app constructs a byte array and uses bluetoothGatt.writeCharacteristic() to send it to the appropriate characteristic on the device.42

#### **7.3 Building a Robust Bluetooth Service**

To ensure a stable user experience, all Bluetooth communication logic should be encapsulated within a bound Android Service. This service will manage the connection lifecycle, handle disconnections and reconnections, and expose a clean API (e.g., sendCommand(command)) to the UI layer. This architecture prevents the connection from being terminated if the user navigates away from the app and allows for more robust error handling.40

### **Chapter 8: Specialized Integration: Flipper Zero and MSRX6BT**

Not all hardware can be directly controlled. It is crucial to distinguish between emulators that are controlled and reader/writer devices that are configured.

#### **8.1 Interfacing with the Flipper Zero Mobile App**

The Flipper Zero has its own official Android application for device management over Bluetooth.44 This app provides file management, firmware updates, and other features. There is no public API for third-party apps to directly control applications running on the Flipper, such as the MagSpoof app. Therefore, a direct real-time control approach is not feasible. Instead, a companion Android app should function as a data management tool. The app can be used to create, edit, and store .mag files in a user-friendly way. These files can then be easily transferred to the Flipper Zero using Android's sharing features to send the file to the official Flipper Mobile App, or by connecting the Flipper's SD card to the phone.

#### **8.2 Interfacing with Reader/Writer Devices (e.g., MSRX6BT)**

Devices like the Deftun MSRX6BT are fundamentally different from MagSpoof. They are magnetic stripe *readers and writers*, designed to physically encode data onto blank cards, not to emulate a swipe wirelessly.45 These devices often have their own proprietary Bluetooth protocols and dedicated mobile apps, such as "EasyMSR".45 Integrating with such a device would require either an official SDK from the manufacturer, which is often not publicly available 48, or a significant reverse-engineering effort to decipher its Bluetooth communication protocol. This places them outside the scope of a general-purpose MagSpoof control application.

### **Chapter 9: Application UI and Secure Data Management**

#### **9.1 UI/UX for Managing Track Data**

The application's user interface should be designed for clarity and efficiency. A modern UI toolkit like Jetpack Compose is well-suited for this task. The primary screens would include:

* A main list displaying all saved card profiles.  
* A detail/editor screen with input fields for a profile name, Track 1 data, and Track 2 data.  
* A connection status indicator to show the currently connected hardware.  
* A main control panel to select a profile and send the "emulate" command to the hardware.

#### **9.2 Parsing Magnetic Stripe Data**

To improve data integrity, the application can incorporate a library to validate user input. The magnetictrackparser is a Java library that can parse raw track strings, validate their format, and extract fields like the Primary Account Number (PAN) and expiration date.49 Using such a library can prevent malformed data from being sent to the MagSpoof device.

#### **9.3 Secure Storage of Sensitive Data**

Magnetic stripe data is highly sensitive. Storing this data in plaintext within the application's standard SharedPreferences or an unencrypted database is a significant security risk. It is imperative to use Android's strongest available security mechanisms. The recommended approach is to use the Jetpack Security library, which provides an implementation of EncryptedSharedPreferences. This class automatically encrypts keys and values, using a master key that is generated and stored securely within the Android Keystore System. This ensures that the stored track data is protected by hardware-backed encryption on supported devices, making it inaccessible even on a rooted phone.

## **Conclusion**

The field of magnetic stripe emulation has evolved significantly from its DIY origins into a sophisticated ecosystem of commercial tools and modular platforms. Devices like the MagSpoof series, NFC Copy Cat, BomberCat, and the various Flipper Zero modules provide security researchers with a powerful and increasingly accessible set of capabilities for auditing magnetic stripe-based systems. The clear trend is toward multi-protocol integration and user-friendly software interfaces, lowering the barrier to entry and enabling more complex security assessments.

For developers, creating an Android application to manage these devices presents a multifaceted challenge centered on communication fragmentation. A successful control application must be architected with a flexible, multi-backend communication service to handle USB, Bluetooth Classic, and BLE protocols. Furthermore, given the highly sensitive nature of the data being handled, developers have a critical responsibility to implement robust security measures, utilizing modern, hardware-backed encryption for all stored data.

Ultimately, the power of these tools necessitates a constant and unwavering commitment to ethical use. They are indispensable for identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities but must be wielded exclusively within the bounds of authorized, legal, and responsible security research.

### **Appendix B: Extended Source Code Examples**

#### **Example 1: Android Bluetooth LE GATT Callback (Kotlin)**

This snippet shows a basic structure for a BluetoothGattCallback to handle connection and service discovery for a BLE-based MagSpoof device.

Kotlin

private val gattCallback \= object : BluetoothGattCallback() {  
    override fun onConnectionStateChange(gatt: BluetoothGatt, status: Int, newState: Int) {  
        if (newState \== BluetoothProfile.STATE\_CONNECTED) {  
            Log.i("BluetoothGattCallback", "Successfully connected to ${gatt.device.address}")  
            // Discover services after successful connection  
            gatt.discoverServices()  
        } else if (newState \== BluetoothProfile.STATE\_DISCONNECTED) {  
            Log.i("BluetoothGattCallback", "Disconnected from ${gatt.device.address}")  
            // Handle disconnection  
        }  
    }

    override fun onServicesDiscovered(gatt: BluetoothGatt, status: Int) {  
        if (status \== BluetoothGatt.GATT\_SUCCESS) {  
            // Find the service and characteristics we need for control  
            val service \= gatt.getService(UUID.fromString("YOUR\_SERVICE\_UUID"))  
            val commandCharacteristic \= service?.getCharacteristic(UUID.fromString("YOUR\_COMMAND\_CHAR\_UUID"))  
            // Store references to these characteristics for later use  
        } else {  
            Log.w("BluetoothGattCallback", "onServicesDiscovered received: $status")  
        }  
    }

    override fun onCharacteristicWrite(gatt: BluetoothGatt, characteristic: BluetoothGattCharacteristic, status: Int) {  
        if (status \== BluetoothGatt.GATT\_SUCCESS) {  
            Log.i("BluetoothGattCallback", "Write successful for ${characteristic.uuid}")  
        }  
    }  
}

#### **Example 2: Android Secure Data Storage with Jetpack Security (Kotlin)**

This snippet demonstrates how to create and use EncryptedSharedPreferences to securely store a magnetic stripe track.

Kotlin

import androidx.security.crypto.EncryptedSharedPreferences  
import androidx.security.crypto.MasterKeys

// Create or retrieve the master key  
val masterKeyAlias \= MasterKeys.getOrCreate(MasterKeys.AES256\_GCM\_SPEC)

// Create the EncryptedSharedPreferences instance  
val sharedPreferences \= EncryptedSharedPreferences.create(  
    "secret\_shared\_prefs",  
    masterKeyAlias,  
    context,  
    EncryptedSharedPreferences.PrefKeyEncryptionScheme.AES256\_SIV,  
    EncryptedSharedPreferences.PrefValueEncryptionScheme.AES256\_GCM  
)

// Write sensitive data  
fun saveTrackData(profileName: String, track2Data: String) {  
    with(sharedPreferences.edit()) {  
        putString("PROFILE\_${profileName}\_TRACK2", track2Data)  
        apply()  
    }  
}

// Read sensitive data  
fun readTrackData(profileName: String): String? {  
    return sharedPreferences.getString("PROFILE\_${profileName}\_TRACK2", null)  
}
