### Feasibility Analysis of Proprietary System Integration

This section discusses the feasibility of integrating the application with proprietary systems like Samsung's Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST) and the hardware from the defunct company Coin.

*   **Samsung MST:** Direct integration with Samsung's MST is not feasible. Samsung does not provide a public API for low-level access to the MST hardware. The functionality is deeply integrated into the Samsung Pay platform and protected by Samsung's KNOX security framework. Furthermore, Samsung is phasing out MST hardware in its newer devices.
*   **Coin Hardware:** Integration with Coin hardware is also not recommended. The company is defunct, and the product is no longer supported. Any integration effort would require a full-scale reverse-engineering project, which is complex and has no guarantee of success.
