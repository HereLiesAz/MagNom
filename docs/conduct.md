## Code of Conduct

This project is intended for educational and research purposes. The technology is legally neutral, but its application in emulating magnetic stripes, particularly for payment cards, is in a legally and ethically sensitive area.

*   **Legal Landscape:** The unauthorized use of an "access device" to obtain goods or services is a serious federal crime. The act of capturing card data without authorization, known as "skimming," is also illegal. While using the device to emulate a card that one legally owns and is authorized to use may occupy a legal gray area, the potential for misuse is enormous.
*   **User Responsibility:** Any distribution of this application must be accompanied by strong, explicit warnings that its use for fraudulent purposes is illegal and that the user bears all responsibility for their actions.
*   **Positioning and Marketing Strategy:** The application must be meticulously positioned as an educational tool or a developer utility. The app's name, description, and UI should scrupulously avoid any language related to "spoofing," "cloning," or payments.
*   **Responsible Feature Withholding:** The production application should avoid implementing any features that have a primary application in fraudulent activity.
