## Section 1: Foundational Principles of Magnetic Stripe Technology

The successful emulation of magnetic stripe cards necessitates a foundational understanding of the standards governing their data structure and the physical principles by which that data is encoded and read. This section provides a detailed deconstruction of the ISO/IEC 7811 and 7813 standards that define the logical data layout on a card's magnetic stripe. It then delves into the physics of magnetic data storage and the specific F2F (Frequency/Double Frequency) encoding scheme, which translates logical bits into the physical magnetic phenomena that card readers detect. A comprehensive grasp of both the logical and physical layers is a prerequisite for designing a system capable of generating a valid and readable emulated signal.
