## Performance

The application's performance is influenced by its architecture and communication protocol.

*   **Architecture:** The use of a modern architectural pattern like MVVM helps to create a responsive and efficient application by separating concerns and managing the UI's state effectively.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is the recommended communication protocol. It provides a good balance of data rate and power consumption, making it ideal for this application.
