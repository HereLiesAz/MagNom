# **A Developer's Guide to Interfacing with Magspoof v4 via Android USB Host Mode**

## **Introduction**

The Electronic Cats Magspoof v4 is a specialized hardware tool designed for security research and penetration testing, capable of emulating magnetic stripe data wirelessly by generating a precise electromagnetic field.1 This functionality allows security professionals to audit and understand the behavior of magnetic stripe readers in a controlled environment. While the device can be pre-programmed with static data using the Arduino IDE, its true potential is unlocked through dynamic, real-time control. This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step methodology for developing a native Android application to manage and control the Magspoof v4 over a direct USB connection.

The objective of this project is to architect a functional Android application that can send magnetic stripe track data (Track 1 and Track 2\) to the Magspoof v4, commanding it to perform an emulation on demand. The core technological framework for this endeavor is the Android USB Host API, a powerful but complex set of tools available in Android 3.1 (API level 12\) and higher.3 To abstract the low-level complexities of USB endpoint and interface management, this guide will leverage the mik3y/usb-serial-for-android library, a well-established, open-source solution for communicating with USB serial devices.5

This document will proceed from a foundational analysis of the Magspoof v4 hardware and its communication protocol to the detailed implementation of the Android application. It will cover project setup, manifest configuration, device discovery, permission handling, data formatting, and transmission logic. Finally, it will address advanced topics such as firmware dependencies, troubleshooting, and the critical legal and ethical responsibilities associated with the use of such a device. As stated by the manufacturer, the Magspoof is intended solely for authorized security audits, and its use must comply with all applicable laws and regulations.1

## **Section 1: An Architectural Review of the Magspoof v4**

A thorough understanding of the target hardware and its firmware is a prerequisite for successful software development. This section deconstructs the Magspoof v4's core components, communication interface, and identification parameters, providing the necessary foundation for building a robust Android control application.

### **1.1 Core Components and System-on-Chip (SoC) Analysis**

The Magspoof v4 is a compact device built around a specific microcontroller that dictates its capabilities and the software toolchain required to program it.7 While product listings from Electronic Cats mention both an ARM Cortex M0 (ATSAMD11C14A) and an E8051 CH552 processor, a definitive identification is crucial for development.7 The official "Getting Started" guide for the Magspoof v4 resolves this ambiguity by instructing users to install the ch55xduino board manager in the Arduino IDE.2 This requirement is a direct indicator that the Magspoof v4 is based on the WCH CH55x series of 8-bit microcontrollers, which use an 8051-compatible core.

This distinction is critical. Other, more complex Electronic Cats products that incorporate Magspoof functionality, such as the NFC Copy Cat and the BomberCat, utilize different microcontrollers like the SAMD21 ARM Cortex M0 and the RP2040, respectively.8 An attempt to use libraries or firmware intended for those devices with the standalone Magspoof v4 would fail. The development process outlined in this guide is therefore tailored specifically to the CH55x architecture and the corresponding ch55xduino environment. The device's technical specifications indicate it operates at 3.3V, has 16KB of flash memory and 4KB of RAM, and connects via a USB-C port.7

### **1.2 The USB Communication Paradigm: CDC ACM Virtual COM Port**

The Magspoof v4, when flashed with a firmware that enables external control, does not implement a proprietary or complex USB protocol. Instead, it utilizes the standard USB Communications Device Class (CDC) Abstract Control Model (ACM) protocol. This industry-standard protocol allows the device to present itself to a host system—be it a Windows PC, a Linux machine, or an Android device in USB Host Mode—as a virtual serial port, often referred to as a COM port.10

This architectural choice vastly simplifies the software development process. Rather than engaging in low-level USB packet manipulation, the Android application can interact with the Magspoof v4 as if it were a traditional serial device, sending and receiving streams of ASCII characters. The mik3y/usb-serial-for-android library is specifically designed to handle this scenario, with built-in drivers for CDC/ACM devices.6 The library effectively bridges the gap between the high-level concept of a serial port and the low-level realities of the Android USB Host API, managing the discovery of USB interfaces and endpoints automatically. The communication is thus reduced to opening a port, setting a baud rate, and executing simple read/write operations.

### **1.3 Device Identification: A Practical Guide to Locating VID & PID**

For an Android application to specifically identify and connect to the Magspoof v4, it requires the device's unique USB Vendor ID (VID) and Product ID (PID). These two hexadecimal numbers are fundamental to the USB standard and are used by the host operating system to load the correct drivers and filter device connections.3

The VID and PID for the Magspoof v4 are not explicitly stated in the available documentation. The "Getting Started" guide mentions bootloader IDs (4348, 55E0) used during the flashing process with Zadig, but these may differ from the IDs presented by the device when running its main application firmware.2 Furthermore, these values could potentially change with different firmware versions. Therefore, a reliable approach is for the developer to determine these values empirically from their own device. This skill is transferable and essential for any USB hardware development project. The following table provides step-by-step instructions for locating the VID and PID on common desktop operating systems.

**Table 1: Locating USB Vendor ID (VID) & Product ID (PID) on Host Systems**

| Operating System | Tool/Method | Step-by-Step Instructions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Windows** | Device Manager | 1\. Connect the Magspoof v4 to the computer. 2\. Open Device Manager (press Win \+ X and select Device Manager). 3\. Locate the device under "Ports (COM & LPT)" or "Universal Serial Bus controllers". It may appear as "USB-SERIAL CH340" or a similar name. 4\. Right-click the device and select "Properties". 5\. Go to the "Details" tab and select "Hardware Ids" from the Property dropdown. 6\. The value will be in the format USB\\VID\_XXXX\&PID\_YYYY. XXXX is the VID and YYYY is the PID. |
| **Linux** | lsusb Command | 1\. Open a terminal. 2\. Connect the Magspoof v4. 3\. Run the command lsusb. 4\. A list of connected USB devices will be displayed. Identify the Magspoof v4 in the list. 5\. The entry will be formatted as Bus XXX Device YYY: ID XXXX:YYYY..., where XXXX is the VID and YYYY is the PID. |
| **macOS** | System Information | 1\. Connect the Magspoof v4. 2\. Click the Apple menu, hold the Option key, and select "System Information...". 3\. In the left-hand pane, navigate to "Hardware" \> "USB". 4\. Select the Magspoof v4 from the USB Device Tree. 5\. The "Product ID" and "Vendor ID" (both in hexadecimal, e.g., 0xXXXX) will be displayed in the details pane. |

Once these values are obtained, they can be used to configure the Android application to automatically recognize and request permission for the Magspoof v4.

## **Section 2: Establishing the Android-to-Device Communication Channel**

With a clear understanding of the hardware, the next phase is to construct the Android application's foundation. This section details the process of setting up an Android Studio project, integrating the necessary library, configuring the application manifest, and implementing the core logic to establish a stable communication link with the Magspoof v4.

### **2.1 Fundamentals of the Android USB Host API**

The native Android USB Host API, located in the android.hardware.usb package, provides the underlying framework for an Android device to act as a USB host, power the bus, and communicate with connected peripherals.4 The primary classes involved in this process are 13:

* UsbManager: The main entry point for accessing and managing USB devices. It is used to enumerate connected devices and request permission for communication.  
* UsbDevice: Represents a connected USB peripheral. It provides access to descriptive information, including the VID, PID, and its various interfaces.  
* UsbDeviceConnection: Represents an active connection to a UsbDevice. This class is used to perform the actual data transfer over the device's endpoints.

The standard workflow involves using the UsbManager to get a list of all connected UsbDevice objects. The application then identifies the target device (e.g., by its VID and PID), requests user permission to access it, and, upon receiving consent, opens a UsbDeviceConnection. This process, while powerful, requires manual handling of interfaces and endpoints, which can be complex. The use of a specialized library simplifies this flow significantly.

### **2.2 Project Integration: Incorporating the usb-serial-for-android Library**

The first practical step in building the application is to integrate the mik3y/usb-serial-for-android library into an Android Studio project. This is accomplished by modifying the project's Gradle build files.5

First, the jitpack.io repository, which hosts the library, must be added. In modern Android projects using Gradle 6.8 or newer, this is done in the settings.gradle file:

Groovy

// settings.gradle  
dependencyResolutionManagement {  
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL\_ON\_PROJECT\_REPOS)  
    repositories {  
        google()  
        mavenCentral()  
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' } // Add this line  
    }  
}

Next, the library dependency itself is added to the module-level build.gradle file (typically app/build.gradle):

Groovy

// app/build.gradle  
dependencies {  
    //... other dependencies  
    implementation 'com.github.mik3y:usb-serial-for-android:3.9.0' // Add this line  
}

After syncing the project with the updated Gradle files, the library's classes will be available for use within the application.

### **2.3 Manifest Configuration for USB Host Functionality**

To enable USB Host mode and allow the application to interact with the Magspoof v4, several key entries must be added to the AndroidManifest.xml file. These configurations declare the app's hardware requirements and set up a system for automatically detecting the device upon connection.3

1. **Feature Declaration**: A \<uses-feature\> tag is required to declare that the application uses the USB Host APIs. This ensures that the app can only be installed from the Google Play Store on devices that physically support USB Host mode.  
   XML  
   \<uses-feature android:name\="android.hardware.usb.host" /\>

2. **Intent Filter for Auto-Launch**: To allow the Android system to notify the application when the Magspoof v4 is connected, an intent filter for the USB\_DEVICE\_ATTACHED action is added to the main activity.  
   XML  
   \<intent-filter\>  
       \<action android:name\="android.hardware.usb.action.USB\_DEVICE\_ATTACHED" /\>  
   \</intent-filter\>

3. **Device Filtering Metadata**: A \<meta-data\> tag is paired with the intent filter to point to an XML resource file. This file specifies the VID and PID of the Magspoof v4, telling the system to launch this specific app only when that particular device is connected.  
   XML  
   \<meta-data  
       android:name\="android.hardware.usb.action.USB\_DEVICE\_ATTACHED"  
       android:resource\="@xml/device\_filter" /\>

The referenced resource file, device\_filter.xml, must be created in the res/xml/ directory. This file contains the VID and PID discovered in Section 1.3. The developer must replace the placeholder values (XXXX) with the actual hexadecimal values for their device.

XML

\<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?\>  
\<resources\>  
    \<usb-device vendor-id\="0xXXXX" product-id\="0xXXXX" /\>  
\</resources\>

### **2.4 Implementing the Connection Logic**

With the project configured, the core connection logic can be implemented in the application's main activity. The usb-serial-for-android library greatly simplifies this process by abstracting the native API calls into a more intuitive, serial-port-oriented model.5

The process begins by obtaining an instance of the UsbManager and using the library's UsbSerialProber to find all available serial drivers.

Java

// In your Activity class  
private UsbSerialPort port;

private void connectToDevice() {  
    UsbManager manager \= (UsbManager) getSystemService(Context.USB\_SERVICE);  
    List\<UsbSerialDriver\> availableDrivers \= UsbSerialProber.getDefaultProber().findAllDrivers(manager);  
    if (availableDrivers.isEmpty()) {  
        // No devices found  
        return;  
    }

    // Find the specific Magspoof driver  
    UsbSerialDriver driver \= null;  
    for (UsbSerialDriver d : availableDrivers) {  
        // Replace with your device's VID and PID  
        if (d.getDevice().getVendorId() \== 0xXXXX && d.getDevice().getProductId() \== 0xYYYY) {  
            driver \= d;  
            break;  
        }  
    }

    if (driver \== null) {  
        // Magspoof device not found  
        return;  
    }

    // Check for permission and open the device  
    if (\!manager.hasPermission(driver.getDevice())) {  
        // Request permission  
        PendingIntent permissionIntent \= PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, new Intent("com.your.package.USB\_PERMISSION"), PendingIntent.FLAG\_IMMUTABLE);  
        manager.requestPermission(driver.getDevice(), permissionIntent);  
        return;  
    }

    UsbDeviceConnection connection \= manager.openDevice(driver.getDevice());  
    if (connection \== null) {  
        // Could not open device  
        return;  
    }

    port \= driver.getPorts().get(0); // Most devices have one port  
    try {  
        port.open(connection);  
        // Set serial parameters. 115200 is a common baud rate.  
        port.setParameters(115200, 8, UsbSerialPort.STOPBITS\_1, UsbSerialPort.PARITY\_NONE);  
        // Connection successful  
    } catch (IOException e) {  
        // Handle error  
        try {  
            port.close();  
        } catch (IOException ignored) {}  
        port \= null;  
    }  
}

This code demonstrates the complete flow: enumerating devices, identifying the specific Magspoof v4 by its VID/PID, requesting user permission if necessary, and finally opening a connection and configuring the serial port parameters. The library handles the complex task of finding the correct USB interfaces and endpoints, allowing the developer to focus on high-level serial input/output.

## **Section 3: Defining the Magspoof v4 Serial Control Protocol**

Once a communication channel is established, the application must send data in a format that the Magspoof v4's firmware can understand. Since an explicit protocol is not documented, one must be deduced by combining knowledge of standard magnetic stripe formats with clues found in the device's firmware and setup guides. This section defines the structure of the data payload and proposes a simple command protocol for controlling the device.

### **3.1 Deconstructing Magnetic Stripe Data Formats (ISO/IEC 7813\)**

The data that the Magspoof emulates originates from the international standards for financial transaction cards, primarily ISO/IEC 7813\. The device supports all three tracks, but Tracks 1 and 2 are the most common.1

* **Track 1**: Developed by IATA, this track is alphanumeric and can store up to 79 characters. Each character is encoded using a 7-bit scheme (6 data bits plus one parity bit). The data is framed by a start sentinel, %, and an end sentinel, ?. It typically contains the primary account number (PAN), cardholder name, expiration date, and other discretionary data.  
* **Track 2**: Developed by the ABA, this track is numeric-only (digits 0-9 and the \= separator) and can store up to 40 characters. Each character is encoded using a 5-bit scheme (4 data bits plus one parity bit). The data is framed by a start sentinel, ;, and an end sentinel, ?. It typically contains the PAN and expiration date.

The Android application must prepare the raw magnetic stripe data according to these structural rules, including the correct sentinels, before any further formatting.

### **3.2 Firmware-Specific Data Formatting and Character Substitution**

A critical step in preparing the data payload involves accounting for quirks in the device's firmware parser. The "Getting Started" guide for the Magspoof v4 provides explicit instructions for character substitutions that must be made when hardcoding track data into an Arduino sketch.2 These substitutions are necessary because certain characters may have special meanings within the C++ source code or the firmware's internal parsing functions. It is highly probable that these same constraints apply to data sent over the serial port.

The documented substitutions are 2:

* For Track 1:  
  * & must be replaced with ^  
  * \- must be replaced with /  
* For Track 2:  
  * ñ must be replaced with ;  
  * ¿ must be replaced with \=

The Android application must programmatically perform these character replacements on the raw track data before wrapping it in the command protocol. Failure to do so would likely result in parsing errors on the device, causing the emulation to fail. This demonstrates how artifacts from the firmware development process can provide essential clues about an otherwise undocumented communication protocol.

### **3.3 The Deduced Command Protocol**

The final piece of the puzzle is the command structure used to transmit the formatted track data and trigger the spoofing action. The Magspoof v4 "Getting Started" guide mentions the existence of a "newest firmware, which enables you to submit card tracks through USB and immediately simulate them".2 This confirms that a serial control protocol exists, even if it is not explicitly defined.

Based on common practices in embedded systems design, a simple, robust, and human-readable protocol can be proposed. An effective protocol uses command prefixes to identify the data type and a delimiter to signal the end of a command. A newline character (\\n) is a standard and reliable delimiter.

The proposed command protocol is as follows:

* **To send Track 1 data**: T1:\<formatted\_track\_1\_data\>\\n  
* **To send Track 2 data**: T2:\<formatted\_track\_2\_data\>\\n  
* **To trigger the emulation**: SPOOF\\n

In this protocol, T1: and T2: are unambiguous prefixes. The application would first send the track data commands to load the data into the Magspoof's memory. It would then send the SPOOF command to instruct the device to begin generating the electromagnetic field based on the loaded data. This multi-command approach is flexible and allows for updating tracks without necessarily triggering an immediate spoof.

The following table consolidates all formatting rules into a single reference.

**Table 2: Magspoof v4 Data Formatting and Command Protocol**

| Element | Raw Data Example | Required Substitutions | Final Serial Command to Send |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Track 1 Data** | %B123456^DOE/JOHN-SMITH^...? | \- becomes / | T1:%B123456^DOE/JOHN/SMITH^...?\\n |
| **Track 2 Data** | ;123456=1812...? | None in this example | T2:;123456=1812...?\\n |
| **Spoof Command** | N/A | N/A | SPOOF\\n |

This defined protocol provides a complete specification for the data that the Android application will transmit to the Magspoof v4.

## **Section 4: A Step-by-Step Implementation of the Android Control Application**

This section integrates the preceding analysis into a functional Android application. It provides the necessary code for the user interface, lifecycle management, and the core logic for formatting and transmitting the magnetic stripe data to the Magspoof v4 according to the defined protocol.

### **4.1 UI/UX for Track Data Input**

A simple and effective user interface is required for data entry and control. The layout will consist of two EditText fields for Track 1 and Track 2, a Button to initiate the spoofing process, and a TextView to display connection status and feedback.

The following XML code defines this layout in activity\_main.xml:

XML

\<LinearLayout xmlns:android\="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"  
    android:layout\_width\="match\_parent"  
    android:layout\_height\="match\_parent"  
    android:orientation\="vertical"  
    android:padding\="16dp"\>

    \<TextView  
        android:id\="@+id/statusTextView"  
        android:layout\_width\="wrap\_content"  
        android:layout\_height\="wrap\_content"  
        android:text\="Status: Disconnected"  
        android:textAppearance\="?android:attr/textAppearanceMedium" /\>

    \<EditText  
        android:id\="@+id/track1EditText"  
        android:layout\_width\="match\_parent"  
        android:layout\_height\="wrap\_content"  
        android:hint\="Track 1 Data"  
        android:inputType\="text" /\>

    \<EditText  
        android:id\="@+id/track2EditText"  
        android:layout\_width\="match\_parent"  
        android:layout\_height\="wrap\_content"  
        android:hint\="Track 2 Data"  
        android:inputType\="text" /\>

    \<Button  
        android:id\="@+id/spoofButton"  
        android:layout\_width\="wrap\_content"  
        android:layout\_height\="wrap\_content"  
        android:layout\_gravity\="center\_horizontal"  
        android:layout\_marginTop\="16dp"  
        android:text\="Send and Spoof" /\>

\</LinearLayout\>

### **4.2 Managing the USB Lifecycle and Permissions**

Proper management of the USB connection within the Android Activity lifecycle is crucial to prevent resource leaks and ensure a stable user experience. The connection should be established when the app becomes active (onResume) and closed when it is paused (onPause).

A BroadcastReceiver is also necessary to handle the result of the USB permission request from the user.

Java

// In MainActivity.java  
@Override  
protected void onResume() {  
    super.onResume();  
    // Register the broadcast receiver for USB permission  
    IntentFilter filter \= new IntentFilter("com.your.package.USB\_PERMISSION");  
    registerReceiver(usbReceiver, filter);  
    // Attempt to connect to the device  
    connectToDevice();  
}

@Override  
protected void onPause() {  
    super.onPause();  
    unregisterReceiver(usbReceiver);  
    // Disconnect from the device  
    if (port\!= null) {  
        try {  
            port.close();  
        } catch (IOException e) {  
            // Ignore  
        }  
        port \= null;  
    }  
}

private final BroadcastReceiver usbReceiver \= new BroadcastReceiver() {  
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {  
        String action \= intent.getAction();  
        if ("com.your.package.USB\_PERMISSION".equals(action)) {  
            synchronized (this) {  
                if (intent.getBooleanExtra(UsbManager.EXTRA\_PERMISSION\_GRANTED, false)) {  
                    // Permission granted, try connecting again  
                    connectToDevice();  
                } else {  
                    // Permission denied  
                    statusTextView.setText("Status: Permission Denied");  
                }  
            }  
        }  
    }  
};

This structure ensures that the application correctly handles permissions and manages the connection state as the user navigates to and from the app.

### **4.3 Transmitting Formatted Payloads**

The core functionality resides in the onClickListener for the "Send and Spoof" button. This is where the user input is retrieved, formatted according to the rules in Section 3, and transmitted over the established serial connection.

Java

// In MainActivity's onCreate method  
spoofButton.setOnClickListener(v \-\> sendSpoofCommands());

private void sendSpoofCommands() {  
    if (port \== null ||\!port.isOpen()) {  
        statusTextView.setText("Status: Device not connected");  
        return;  
    }

    String track1Raw \= track1EditText.getText().toString();  
    String track2Raw \= track2EditText.getText().toString();

    // Perform firmware-specific character substitutions  
    String track1Formatted \= track1Raw.replace('&', '^').replace('-', '/');  
    String track2Formatted \= track2Raw.replace('ñ', ';').replace('¿', '=');

    try {  
        // Send Track 1 data if present  
        if (\!track1Formatted.isEmpty()) {  
            String command1 \= "T1:" \+ track1Formatted \+ "\\n";  
            port.write(command1.getBytes(), 2000); // 2-second timeout  
        }

        // Send Track 2 data if present  
        if (\!track2Formatted.isEmpty()) {  
            String command2 \= "T2:" \+ track2Formatted \+ "\\n";  
            port.write(command2.getBytes(), 2000);  
        }

        // Send the final SPOOF command  
        String spoofCommand \= "SPOOF\\n";  
        port.write(spoofCommand.getBytes(), 2000);

        statusTextView.setText("Status: Commands sent successfully");

    } catch (IOException e) {  
        statusTextView.setText("Status: Error writing to device");  
        // Handle error, maybe try to reconnect  
    }  
}

This implementation follows the complete sequence:

1. Verifies an active connection.  
2. Retrieves the raw data from the UI.  
3. Applies the necessary character substitutions.  
4. Constructs the final command strings, including prefixes and newline delimiters.  
5. Converts the strings to byte arrays and sends them using the port.write() method provided by the library.  
6. Sends the final SPOOF command to trigger the emulation.

### **4.4 Error Handling and User Feedback**

Robust error handling is essential for a reliable application. The port.write() operations are wrapped in a try-catch block to handle potential IOExceptions, which could occur if the device is disconnected during a write operation. The status TextView is updated at each stage of the process, providing the user with clear, real-time feedback on the connection status and the outcome of their actions. This simple feedback mechanism is invaluable for diagnosing issues during use.

## **Section 5: Advanced Considerations and Operational Readiness**

With a functional application, the final step is to address the practical aspects of deployment and use. This includes understanding firmware dependencies, having a strategy for troubleshooting common problems, and adhering to the strict legal and ethical guidelines governing the use of security research tools.

### **5.1 Firmware Dependencies and Flashing**

The entire functionality of the Android control application is contingent on the Magspoof v4 being loaded with a specific firmware that enables the USB serial control interface. The device will not respond to the serial commands defined in this guide if it is running the default, button-activated firmware or no firmware at all. The software on the embedded device is as critical as the software on the Android host.

Users must obtain the correct USB-enabled firmware, likely from the official Electronic Cats GitHub repository for the Magspoof v4 or a related project. The process for flashing this firmware involves using the Arduino IDE with the ch55xduino board manager installed, as detailed in the device's "Getting Started" guide.2 The user must compile and upload this specific firmware to the device before attempting to use the Android application. This is a non-negotiable prerequisite for the system to work as designed.

### **5.2 Troubleshooting and Diagnostics**

Even with a correct implementation, issues can arise from hardware faults, configuration errors, or environmental factors. A systematic approach to troubleshooting can quickly resolve most common problems. The following table outlines potential symptoms, their likely causes, and recommended actions.

**Table 3: Common Troubleshooting Scenarios**

| Symptom | Possible Cause | Recommended Action |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Device not detected in the app** | 1\. Incorrect VID/PID in device\_filter.xml. 2\. Faulty USB OTG cable or adapter. 3\. Android device does not support USB Host Mode. 4\. Magspoof v4 is not powered or has a hardware issue. | 1\. Verify the VID and PID using the methods in Section 1.3 and update the XML file. 2\. Test with a different OTG cable and ensure it is securely connected. 3\. Use a USB host checker app from the Play Store to confirm device capability. 4\. Check for LED indicators on the Magspoof and test its connection to a PC. |
| **App requests permission, but connection fails** | 1\. User denied the USB permission prompt. 2\. A software bug in the connection logic. | 1\. Reconnect the device and ensure "Allow" is selected on the permission dialog. Check app permissions in Android settings. 2\. Review the connectToDevice() and BroadcastReceiver code for logical errors. Use Android Studio's debugger to step through the connection process. |
| **Data sent, but spoofing doesn't work** | 1\. Incorrect data formatting or character substitutions. 2\. The wrong firmware is flashed on the Magspoof v4. 3\. The command protocol is different from the one deduced. 4\. Physical positioning issue with the card reader. | 1\. Double-check the formatting logic against Table 2\. Ensure start/end sentinels are correct and all required substitutions are performed. 2\. Confirm that the USB-enabled firmware has been successfully flashed to the device. 3\. Connect the device to a PC serial terminal (e.g., Arduino Serial Monitor) and experiment with different command formats. 4\. The coil must be positioned correctly over the reader's magnetic head. Experiment with different angles and positions.15 |
