## Faux Pas (Mistakes to Avoid)

To ensure the security and integrity of the application, the following mistakes must be avoided:

*   **Plaintext Storage:** Never store sensitive data, such as card profiles, in plaintext.
*   **Insecure Communication:** Avoid transmitting data over unencrypted channels.
*   **Permanent Storage on Peripheral:** Do not store card profiles permanently in the peripheral's non-volatile flash memory.
*   **Ignoring Legal and Ethical Considerations:** Do not market the application as a tool for illegal activities.
